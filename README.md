# NHL Insights Hub

Welcome to the NHL Insights Hub, a comprehensive resource designed to bring data-driven insights into the world of NHL hockey.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

### `/hub`

The heart of the project, the `/hub` directory, contains the current and actively maintained codebase.

### `/old`

The `/old` directory houses legacy code based on a previous version of the NHL API, which is no longer in active development.
